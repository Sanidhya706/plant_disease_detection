# Plant Disease Detection System

This project uses AI/ML/DL techniques to detect plant diseases from leaf images. The system predicts the disease and suggests treatment options.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-detection.git
    cd plant-disease-detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Model

- The model is a trained neural network that classifies plant diseases based on the leaf images.
- The trained model is stored in the `model/model.h5` file.
